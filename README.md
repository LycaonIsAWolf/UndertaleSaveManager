[UNDERTALE](http://undertale.com/) is a wonderful RPG by [Toby Fox](https://twitter.com/FwugRadiation).</div>

This is a save manager for it. It will let you store backups of your game, reload backups, and nuke all your files, for the purposes of experimentation.</div>

You can download version 0.1 [here.](http://lycaon.me/UndertaleSaveManager.7z)</div>

To save a backup: hit the "Backup current files as" button and enter a name that will help you remember which save file that is.</div>

To load a backup: simply hit the select the "Load backed up files" button and .undertale file (created by UndertaleSaveManager.exe) in the folder of the backup you want to load.
